# Chaînage Efficace de Contour

This repository contains the archived source code of Chaînage Efficace de Contour, a legacy Software developped as of 1970 at Inria. 
MySoftware source code can be discovered via two different angles, materialized as two different branches. 

## Main Branch

The main branch contains the original materials as well as the metada linked to mySoftware. 
The original finds are stored in the Depository containing the raw materials and the browsable source.
- Folder [raw materials](./raw_materials) is for the original source code materials, as they have been found or submitted.
- Folder [source_code](./source_code) is for a machine readable version of the source code. Source files, with the right extension, have to be accessible through the GitHub web interface, e.g., archives should be decompressed, code should be transcribed if provided by images, etc.This folder serves as a base for the reconstruction of the development history as a git repository.
- Folder [metadata](/.metadata) holds various files with meta information to be updated throughout the process. 


## SourceCode Branch
The SourceCode branch contains the reconstructed synthetic development history of MySoftware. 
Each version of the source code has been stacked one upon the other using successive commits. 


# The process

This repository was created with the support of the Software Heritage Acquisition Process (SWHAP).

For general considerations about the process, check out the [SWHAP guide](https://www.softwareheritage.org/swhap/) as initially published in 2019 with UNESCO.
For a detailed step by step description of the process, check out the [SWHAP@Inria guide](https://github.com/mathfichen/swhapguide). The SWHAP@Inria guide is itself a simplified version of the step by step [SHWAP@Pisa guide](https://github.com/SoftwareHeritage/swhapguide/blob/master/SWHAP%40Pisa.pdf) published by the university of Pisa.
